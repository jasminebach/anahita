## Inspiration
With limited options, added with rapid depleting water sources. Anahita create Integrated Rainfall Usage and Water Monitoring Solutions equipped with IoT Hardware solutions

## What it does
Anahita uses rain, as the primary source for several needs. Using dynamic benchmarking, Anahita provides personalized insights on the water needed for each family 

## How we built it
- Frontend: Using Flutter, translating initial UI/UX from Figma into code-based front-end
- Backend: Using Arduino as the IoT systems to pull the data from hardware and deliver actions on the IoT systems
- Database: Using CSV as dummy data to project dynamic benchmarking, that will further processing using Time-series Analysis in Python

## Challenges we ran into
- Incorporating Flutter as front-end systems takes sometime to translate visual UI into code-based systems
- Ensuring the IoT hardware works through multiple-trials of set-up

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Readable sensor with action on switching pipes action as our IoT systems
- Generate daily usage insights using Time-series Analysis to track general, seasonal and situational based trends 
- Having Flutter to represent in simple-manner on the app visualization

## What we learned
- Working on multiple set-up ranging from front-end, back-end with real IoT hardware to solve the core issue implemented, and utilizing machine-learning to generate prescriptive methods on water consumption and alternative sources of rainwater harvesting to optimize cost-saving and environment

## What's next for Anahita
- Rainwater filtering system for general usage.
- Integrated rainwater data forecasting from BMKG (volume, quality, etc.).
- Deeper customer profile insight for automatic water distribution & allocation.
